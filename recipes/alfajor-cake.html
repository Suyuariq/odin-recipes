    <figcaption>Rogel, a delicious and visually stunning dessert.</figcaption>
    <br>
    <p>In a nutshell, this cake is made from many layers of crunchy, crispy biscuit pastry lathered with delicious, creamy, sweet dulce de leche caramel. The cake is then topped with soft meringue.</p> 
    <p>Alfajor cake is made with layers of shortbread-like cookies and (A LOT of) dulce de leche cream.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 (13.4 ounce) can dulce de leche</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Beat butter with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of bowl as needed, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating until incorporated after each addition, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture to butter mixture in 3 additions, alternating alternately with the milk, starting and ending with the flour mixture, and beat until combined after each addition.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and turn to coat dough. Knead dough 2 or 3 times.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 5 equal pieces and shape each piece into a ball.</li>
        <li>Working with 1 ball at a time, roll dough into a 7-inch circle. Place dough circles on 2 large rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment paper (I fit 3 circles on 1 sheet and 2 on the other). Chill dough circles, uncovered, for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prick each dough circle lightly with a fork.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned on bottom and light browned around the edges, 15 to 18 minutes. (If baking in 2 batches, keep second batch refrigerated while first batch bakes.) Cool cake layers completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon dulce de leche into a medium bowl. Beat cream with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently stir half of cream mixture into dulce de leche until combined. Gently fold remaining cream into dulce de leche mixture until combined.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 cup of the dulce de leche mixture onto 1 cake layer, spreading to edges. Place onto a serving platter with dulce de leche mixture facing up. Repeat process with the next 3 cake layers (this is easier to spread on cake layers before placing on platter). Spread remaining 2/3 cup dulce de leche mixture onto fifth cake layer and place on top.</li>
        <li>Let stand 1 hour. Dust top of cake with powdered sugar and serve. Cover any leftovers with plastic wrap and store in refrigerator up to 1 day.</li>
    </ol>
